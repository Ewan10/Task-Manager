# Task-Manager 2nd version

Improved version of TaskManager v1. In TaskManager v2 there have been many structural changes and functional extensions introduced relatively to TaskManager version 1. Among those changes the major ones are: the apache commons cli has been introduced for user command input, the capability for the user to save a session and load it using object serialization provided by the I/O Java library, the addition of insertion sort algorithm for sorting the task according to the date, the use of the time library for taking benefit of the LocalDate and LocalTime objects and their methods for date and time processing and many methods dealing with many concerns from the first version have been restructured and are using many smaller private helper methods.
