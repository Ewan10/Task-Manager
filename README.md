# Task-Manager

# Description

This application will allow the users to manage the scheduling of their personal tasks. The user will be able to add a new task each time with a title and a date. He will be able to change the date of a stored task, to view the tasks which are due today, to view all the stored tasks and to change the status of a task. 

For the development the IDE of VSCode will be used as a well-known reliable and lightweight package. The project will be built with Maven allowing the integration of any libraries. Also a well-known and established package for building java projects. There were no any special requirements for using a more sophisticated build tool. 

The project will be developed according to the software design principles of readability, testability and extensibility.

# Instructions of compiling the project
