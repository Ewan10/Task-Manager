# Task-Manager

This application will allow the users to manage the scheduling of their personal tasks. The user will be able to add a new task each time with a title and a date.
He will be able to change the date of a stored task, to view the tasks which are due today, to view all the tasks and to mark a task as complete. The design wiil 
consist of two classes, a Task class, and a TaskManager class. The fields of the Task class will be title, date and status (of completion). An arrayList will be
used by the TaskManager to store the Task objects, access and write their fields. The application will use a console text user interface. The user will be prompted 
what to type for a certain operation e.g. to view the task which are due today he must type "today". Java's regular expressions class is used for the validation, 
processing and comparison of the date entered from the user and the Date() object. The application will be distributed as a java file and the files of the util package 
and regular expressions must also be downloaded.
